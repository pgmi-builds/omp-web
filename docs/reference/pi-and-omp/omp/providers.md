# Providers

> Choose an account, API-key, local, or custom model route; authenticate it; and select a model that omp can actually use.

## Choose the route that fits

A provider is the account or backend, such as `anthropic`, `openai-codex`, or `ollama`. A model is selected as `provider/model-id`.

For most people, the shortest path is:

1. Start `omp`.
2. Run `/model`.
3. Choose a provider. Providers without credentials appear as **not configured**; select one and press Enter to start its login flow when available.
4. Choose a model after login finishes.

Use this table if you already know how you want to authenticate:

| Route | Best for | First action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OAuth or account sign-in | Browser, device-code, and hosted-account flows | In omp, run `/login`, or jump to one provider with `/login openai-codex` |
| Coding subscription | ChatGPT Plus/Pro, Claude Pro/Max, Copilot, and other supported plans | Use the plan's provider ID, not the vendor's API provider ID |
| API key | Usage-based APIs, CI, and non-interactive shells | Export the provider's environment variable, then start omp |
| Local engine | Private or offline-capable inference with Ollama, llama.cpp, or LM Studio | Start the engine; omp discovers it without a login |
| Custom endpoint | Team gateways, self-hosted APIs, and providers not built in | Add the endpoint to `~/.omp/agent/models.yml` |

Account subscriptions and developer APIs are often separate products. For example, ChatGPT credentials use `openai-codex`; `openai` expects `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Google and xAI have similar splits. See [Provider-specific caveats](#provider-specific-caveats) before guessing an ID.

## Get one route working

### Sign in with OAuth or a subscription

Inside an interactive session:

```text
/login openai-codex
```

Follow the browser, device-code, or paste-code instructions shown by omp. For a remote terminal, the flow may ask you to paste the final redirect URL or code back as `/login <value>`. When a provider supports several accounts or workspaces, run `/login <provider>` again to add another one; omp can rotate managed accounts.

Then verify and select a concrete model:

```sh
omp models openai-codex
omp --model openai-codex/gpt-5.5
```

`omp models <provider>` prints only models currently available to this installation. Copy a selector from that output if the example model has changed. In an existing session, run `/model` or `/model provider/model-id` instead.

Use `/logout` to choose credentials to remove, or `/logout <provider>` to open that provider directly.

### Use an API key

For a one-off launch or CI job, put the key in the process environment:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... omp --model openai/gpt-5.5
```

For an interactive setup, many key-based providers also appear in `/login`; omp opens the provider's key page, asks for the key, validates it, and stores the credential. Providers without a login entry use their environment variable.

To persist an environment variable without adding it to shell startup files, omp loads `.env` files. An already-exported process value wins, followed by:

1. `<current-directory>/.env`
2. `~/.omp/agent/.env`
3. `~/.omp/.env`
4. `~/.env`

Do not commit a project `.env` containing secrets. See [Environment variables](/docs/env) for every provider key name and the complete `.env` rules.

Verify the route before starting a long task:

```sh
omp models openai
omp --model openai/gpt-5.5 "Reply with the model provider and model ID you are using."
```

### Use a local engine

omp probes these local providers automatically:

| Provider ID | Default endpoint | Override |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ollama` | `http://127.0.0.1:11434` | `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, then `OLLAMA_HOST` |
| `llama.cpp` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080` | `LLAMA_CPP_BASE_URL` |
| `lm-studio` | `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1` | `LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL` |

Start the engine and load a model there first. No login or config file is required for the default keyless endpoints. Then ask omp what it found:

```sh
omp models ollama
```

Copy a selector from the output:

```sh
omp --model ollama/model-id
```

If an engine is on another machine, set its base-URL environment variable. An explicit provider with the same ID in `models.yml` replaces automatic discovery. `vllm` is also a built-in provider route, but configure or authenticate it when it is not exposed as an unauthenticated local endpoint.

### Add a custom provider

Use `~/.omp/agent/models.yml` for an OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, or other supported public endpoint. This minimal example reads the key from `MY_GATEWAY_API_KEY`:

```yaml
providers:
  my-gateway:
    baseUrl: https://gateway.example.com/v1
    api: openai-completions
    apiKey: MY_GATEWAY_API_KEY
    models:
      - id: fast-chat
        name: Fast Chat
        contextWindow: 128000
        maxTokens: 8192
```

Set the key and verify the loaded entry:

```sh
export MY_GATEWAY_API_KEY=...
omp models my-gateway
omp --model my-gateway/fast-chat
```

`apiKey` is resolved as an environment-variable name first and otherwise as literal text. Prefer an environment-variable name so the secret stays out of the file. Use `auth: none` instead of `apiKey` for a genuinely keyless endpoint.

See [Custom models & providers](/docs/custom-models) for other wire APIs, model discovery, headers, secret commands, compatibility options, and model overrides.

## How models become available

At startup, omp assembles the model registry in this order:

1. bundled providers and known models;
2. provider overrides and custom models from `~/.omp/agent/models.yml` or `models.yaml`;
3. cached or live discovery for supported providers and local engines;
4. providers and models registered by loaded extensions.

A custom model with the same `provider` and `id` replaces the bundled entry. Runtime discovery can update the models exposed by a provider; model overrides are reapplied afterward.

A model is selectable only when:

- its provider is not in the effective `disabledProviders` list; and
- the provider is keyless or has a credential omp can resolve.

Useful checks:

```sh
omp models                    # all currently available models
omp models find sonnet        # search provider, ID, selector, or display name
omp models refresh            # force fresh online discovery, then list
```

Inside the TUI, `/model` includes available models and shows catalog providers without credentials as locked. Selecting a login-capable locked provider starts its setup. Disabled providers are omitted.

For initial selection, an explicit `--model` wins. Without it, omp considers the active model scope, a saved default, known provider defaults, and finally the first available model. Prefer an exact `provider/model-id` when the same model ID exists through several routes; bare IDs and fuzzy `--model` patterns depend on the available catalog and configured provider order. See [Model roles](/docs/roles) for persistent defaults and task-specific model choices.

## Credential precedence

When several credentials exist for the same provider, omp uses the first applicable source:

1. runtime `--api-key` for this process;
2. `models.yml``providers.<id>.apiKey`;
3. stored OAuth credentials, refreshed when needed;
4. an API key stored by `/login`;
5. the provider environment variable, including values loaded from `.env`;
6. another stored API key, such as a broker-migrated key;
7. a custom-provider fallback resolver.

This means a stored OAuth login normally wins over `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment, while a key explicitly pinned in `models.yml` wins over OAuth. Keep provider IDs separate when you want both account and API access available.

Local credentials normally live in `~/.omp/agent/agent.db`. With an auth broker configured, login, logout, refresh, and credential reads use the remote store instead. See [Secrets and auth](/docs/secrets) for storage, multiple accounts, the auth broker, and the provider-compatible auth gateway.

## Current provider matrix

The live catalog is authoritative: run `omp models` after authenticating. The groups below cover the current built-in model-provider IDs and the normal setup route.

| Route | Provider IDs | Normal setup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Major model APIs | `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `groq`, `mistral`, `xai`, `deepseek`, `openrouter` | API key; `anthropic`, `xai`, `deepseek`, and `openrouter` also offer guided `/login` setup |
| Account and subscription access | `openai-codex`, `github-copilot`, `cursor`, `google-antigravity`, `google-gemini-cli`, `kimi-code`, `xai-oauth`, `devin`, `firepass`, `ollama-cloud` | `/login <provider>` |
| Coding plans and regional portals | `aiand`, `alibaba-coding-plan`, `alibaba-token-plan`, `minimax-code`, `minimax-code-cn`, `qwen-portal`, `umans`, `xiaomi`, `xiaomi-token-plan-ams`, `xiaomi-token-plan-cn`, `xiaomi-token-plan-sgp`, `zai`, `zhipu-coding-plan` | `/login <provider>`; the flow either signs in or validates a pasted plan key |
| Git-hosted assistants | `gitlab-duo`, `gitlab-duo-agent` | `/login <provider>` or `GITLAB_TOKEN`; GitHub Copilot is listed with subscriptions above |
| Hosted inference APIs | `aimlapi`, `baseten`, `cerebras`, `coreweave`, `fireworks`, `gmi-cloud`, `huggingface`, `meta`, `minimax`, `moonshot`, `nanogpt`, `nvidia`, `novita`, `qianfan`, `sakana`, `siliconflow`, `siliconflow-cn`, `synthetic`, `together`, `venice`, `wafer-serverless` | Provider API key; most also support guided `/login` key entry |
| Gateways and aggregators | `cloudflare-ai-gateway`, `kilo`, `litellm`, `opencode-go`, `opencode-zen`, `vercel-ai-gateway`, `zenmux` | Gateway key and, where required, a base URL or account/team setting |
| Cloud identity routes | `amazon-bedrock`, `bedrock-mantle`, `azure`, `google-vertex` | Cloud-specific credentials and region/project/endpoint configuration |
| Local and self-hosted engines | `ollama`, `llama.cpp`, `lm-studio`, `vllm` | Start the endpoint; authenticate only if the endpoint requires it |

Exact environment-variable names are intentionally centralized in [Environment variables](/docs/env), because some providers accept more than one credential source.

## Provider-specific caveats

| Provider or family | What to know |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI | `openai-codex` is ChatGPT subscription access. `openai` is the developer API and uses `OPENAI_API_KEY`. For a headless Codex sign-in, choose `openai-codex-device`; it stores the result for `openai-codex`. |
| Anthropic | The `anthropic` route supports Claude Pro/Max OAuth and API keys. Repeating login can add separate organizations or subscription workspaces. A pinned `models.yml` key overrides stored OAuth. Foundry deployments have separate enterprise credential settings. |
| Google | `google` uses `GEMINI_API_KEY`; `google-gemini-cli` and `google-antigravity` use account sign-in; `google-vertex` uses Google Cloud project/location credentials. These IDs are not interchangeable. |
| xAI | `xai` is the paid API-key route. `xai-oauth` is the SuperGrok or X Premium+ account route. |
| GitHub Copilot | Login uses GitHub's device flow. Enterprise users must authenticate against the intended Enterprise host; that host and API endpoint are kept with the credential. |
| GitLab Duo | `gitlab-duo` is the non-agentic route; `gitlab-duo-agent` is the Duo Agent route. Both can use `GITLAB_TOKEN`, but their model catalogs and request paths differ. |
| Z.AI | `/login zai` validates a coding-plan API key. The separate sign-in choice `zai-coding-plan` stores its minted credential under the model provider `zai`, so model selectors still start with `zai/`. |
| Azure OpenAI | A key alone is not enough if omp cannot infer your deployment endpoint. Configure the Azure endpoint/deployment route described in [Custom models & providers](/docs/custom-models). |
| Google Vertex | Application Default Credentials require a project and location. A catalog entry may exist before cloud identity is usable, so verify with `omp models google-vertex`. |
| Amazon Bedrock | Bedrock uses the AWS credential chain and region rather than a normal bearer key. `bedrock-mantle` is a separate bearer-token route. |
| Gateways | Use the gateway's provider ID when it has built-in discovery. For a private gateway or nonstandard URL, use `models.yml`; its configured `apiKey` deliberately overrides any stored upstream OAuth token. |
| Local engines | Automatic discovery is skipped when the same provider ID is explicitly configured or disabled. The engine must already be running and expose at least one model. |

## Troubleshooting

**The provider is locked or absent from `omp models`.** Check its credential, then check whether it is disabled:

```sh
omp config get disabledProviders
```

A disabled provider stays unavailable even with valid credentials. Project settings can replace the global `disabledProviders` array; see [Settings](/docs/settings).

**Login succeeded but the model list is stale.** Run `omp models refresh`, then list the provider again. Dynamic catalogs may differ by account, workspace, region, or plan.

**The wrong account or key is used.** Compare your sources with the credential order above. Look for a pinned `models.yml` key, a stored OAuth account, an exported variable, and the four `.env` locations. Remove a managed account with `/logout <provider>`.

**A custom provider is skipped.** Run `omp models`; validation errors are printed before the list. A provider with explicit models needs `baseUrl`, an `api` value, and `apiKey` unless it declares `auth: none`.

**A local provider returns no models.** Confirm the engine is listening at the effective base URL and has a model loaded. Then run `omp models refresh`. An empty or unreachable local endpoint remains unavailable.
